# EEC289A-WheeledRobots

As part of our final 289a project, we will investigate a few strategies for determining a policy to give the vehicle (small ground robot in this case). The policy will be for a generic environment; a strategy for how to navigate around an obstacle it can see the sense the general shape of, by distances to its (and other surrounding obstacles’) surfaces. We will reference (1) and (2) for the obstacle avoidance strategies in reinforcement learning and (3) and others for mecanum wheels-based operations. The robot’s movements and learning will all be simulated.
